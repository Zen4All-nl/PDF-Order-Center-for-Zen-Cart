PDFOC Version 1.2.1 2009-06-28 :: Minor update

- Deleted pdfoc.css in the root of the zip, which shouldn't be there.
- Updated install.txt with the changed instructions to remove te coupon
  code link, which causes some html being displayed. (earlier instructions
  seemed to be not completely correct)

PDFOC Version 1.2 2009-06-15 (based on PDFOC 1.1.1, and now includes update by Paul Mathot)

- Wonderful update by Paul Mathot for several things, merged with the main package.
  (details below)
- Updated the installation instructions according with the update.
- Updated the installation instructions with a patch for the coupon code issue and iDEAL issue.
  (this issue causes that there's some HTML displayed when a coupon code is used,
  or when iDEAL is the payment method.)
- Updated the English and Dutch translation a little bit.
- Added a file with upgrade instructions.
- Removed the EMAIL_DISCLAIMER after the text mail format.
  This because the newer zen-cart versions seem to add it automatically.
  
New features:

1- Disables "Delete Selected Orders" and "Submit Options" when no selection is made
(to prevent you from accidently updating all orders)

2- Optionally hides the "Print Options" form (not hidden by default )

You can switch this option on and off through this new admin setting of PDFOC:
Printing: hide Printing Options?

3- Added a js warning popup message to Process Selected orders button. 
(If this bothers you, you can disable this popup by commenting out the definition of
PDFOC_MESSAGE_SUBMIT_ARE_YOU_SURE in the PDFOC language file.)

So this enables the warning:
define('PDFOC_MESSAGE_SUBMIT_ARE_YOU_SURE', 'Process the selected orders?');

And this disables it:
//define('PDFOC_MESSAGE_SUBMIT_ARE_YOU_SURE', 'Process the selected orders?');

PDFOC Version 1.1.1 2006-06-10 :: bugfix (v1.1 bug)

Hardcoded db table names resulted in errors on shops using table prefixes.

Changes (line 36 + 37 in admin/pdfoc.php):

replaced:
[code]
        $_POST['pull_status'] = $_GET['pull_status'];
        $orders_query = "select o.orders_id, o.customers_id, o.customers_name, o.date_purchased, o.orders_status, ot.text as order_total from orders o left join orders_total ot on (o.orders_id = ot.orders_id) where (ot.class = 'ot_total') and (o.orders_status = '". zen_db_input(zen_db_prepare_input($_POST['pull_status'])) . "') order by orders_id DESC";
[/code]

by:

        $orders_query = "select o.orders_id, o.customers_id, o.customers_name, o.date_purchased, o.orders_status, ot.text as order_total from " . TABLE_ORDERS . " o left join " . TABLE_ORDERS_TOTAL . " ot on (o.orders_id = ot.orders_id) where (ot.class = 'ot_total') and (o.orders_status = '". zen_db_input(zen_db_prepare_input($_GET['pull_status'])) . "') order by orders_id DESC";
