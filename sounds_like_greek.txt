Some extended instructions for those who need them. The steps below correspond
to the steps in the install.txt file.

[1] Create the new orders_invoices table, and add the PDFOC configuration
    parameters to the configuration table in the database.

You have the option, when you install ZC, of specifying a prefix to attach to all
your tables in your database. This is part of the installation process. If you
specify one, say "zen_", then all the Zen Cart tables in your database will begin
with "zen_" : zen_configuration, zen_orders, etc. If you don't specify one, then
these tables will just be configuration, orders, etc.

If you use Admin::Tools::Install SQL Patches to make the database changes in the
file pdfoc.sql, the tool will automatically insert your DB prefix for you. But if
you use phpMyAdmin or similar, you'll have to do that yourself. That means add
"zen_" (or whatever your prefix is) to every table name in that file.

In pdfoc.sql, you'll need to replace the following table names with their prefixed
versions. You can do a search-and-replace to take care of this. In the list below,
I'm assuming your prefix is "zen_"; you should, of course, use your actual prefix
instead.

Replace  orders_invoices       with    zen_orders_invoices
Replace  configuration_group   with    zen_configuration_group
Replace  configuration         with    zen_configuration
